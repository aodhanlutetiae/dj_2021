Eleven workshops ran over the semester. Teams of 3-4 students worked to a three hour deadline on the following topics:

1. Find and present the vote for / against in each of the 22 Welsh local authority areas in the Brexit referendum. Choose how to present the data and put on a live webpage.

2. Download the CSV file of [current MPs](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mps/) that is held by They Work For You. Using the CSV file, build a query into a Google Sheet to allow a user to find their MP using the name - or part of the name - of their constituency. Hide and protect anything that doesn't need to be public while letting the user edit the field where the constituency name is entered. | Repeat the exercise with a dataset of your choosing. | Build a query to let a user see [how their MS voted](https://record.assembly.wales/VoteOutcome/12453#V3271).

3. Build a live webpage with your own story on the 2020 baby names dataset released by the ONS. Include as appropriate: a table, external styling, a responsive layout
