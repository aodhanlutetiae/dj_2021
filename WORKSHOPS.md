These workshops ran over the first semester. Teams of 3-4 students worked to a three-hour deadline on the following topics:

1. Find and present the vote for / against in each of the 22 Welsh local authority areas in the Brexit referendum. Choose how to present the data and put on a live webpage

2. Download the CSV file of [current MPs](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mps/) that is held by They Work For You. Using the CSV file, build a query into a Google Sheet to allow a user to find their MP using the name - or part of the name - of their constituency

3. Build a live webpage with your own story on the 2020 baby names dataset released by the ONS

4. COP26 opens on Sunday in Glasgow. Use numbers to produce a curtain-raiser for a UK (or more local) audience. It can focus on the topic (climate change) or the summit itself, or both. When you have decided on the numbers, find a way to present them online

5.  Analyse the text of all proceedings from the Senedd: first visit the parliament

6.  Now, use [this dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VILSR8&version=1.0) of all recorded speeches of the Fifth Senedd (from 2016-05-05 to 2021-05-05) to build a story

7.  Build a robot reporter function that generates some paragraphs about a particular postcode in the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation, in response to a postcode argument 

8.  Build web apps that pull their information from simple APIs that deliver 1. random jokes 2. the position of the International Space Station

9.  Scrape web data to collect: 1. details of all betting shops in Cardiff 2. all FOI disclosure logs from Coventry Council 3. all second jobs of Westminster MPs

10. What has happened to air in Cardiff over the past two years? Use data from the two networked air quality monitors on Newport road and Queen St

11. How does Flask work? Getting a database-driven website running
